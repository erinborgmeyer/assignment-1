        <p>Born and bred on the beaches of Sydney, Australia, Insight is a clothing brand that has turned heads internationally over the past few years with its dope collections, which include tee shirts, hats, jackets, sweaters, pants, and more. With a central office located in the heart of Sydney, Insight's team stays close to the surf and skate scenes that play a large role in inspiring their designs. Originally launched as a surfboard brand, Insight has evolved over the years into a full-scale fashion boutique.</p>

        <h2>The Registry Number</h2>

        <p>The ship's "NCC-1701" registry number stemmed from "NC" being one of the international aircraft registration codes assigned to aircraft registered in the United States; the second "C" was added for differentiation. According to The Making of Star Trek, "NCC" is the Starfleet abbreviation for "Naval Construction Contract", comparable to what the U.S. Navy would call a hull number. The "1701" was chosen in order to avoid any possible ambiguity; according to Jefferies, the numbers 3, 6, 8, and 9 are "too easily confused". Other sources cite it as a reference to the house across the street from where Roddenberry grew up, while another account gives it as the street address of Linwood Dunn. Jefferies' own sketches provide the explanation that it was his 17th cruiser design with the first serial number of that series: 1701. The Making of Star Trek explains that "USS" should mean "United Space Ship" and that "the Enterprise is a member of the Starship Class".</p>
